          Hi, I’m <strong>Deven Hadkar</strong> — a Full-Stack Developer and IT engineering student passionate about building practical, impactful, and user-focused digital solutions. I enjoy creating applications that solve real-world problems, whether it's improving university workflows, supporting health-related predictions, or promoting environmental awareness.
        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
          With a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures, and database management, I’ve developed multiple academic and personal projects using React, JavaScript, Python, Java, C, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. I love exploring emerging technologies and continuously improving my technical and problem-solving abilities.
        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
          Beyond coding, I’m curious about UI/UX, enjoy understanding how users interact with systems, and like blending functionality with clean, modern interfaces. I’m always striving to learn, adapt, and create solutions that are reliable, scalable, and meaningful.
        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)" }}>
          Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology at Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, I’m eager to contribute to innovative and impactful projects while growing as a developer.
        </p>
